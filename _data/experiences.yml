  details: "Data analysis of genomic sequences included plant, animals and microorganisms.
  <br> <br>
  Whole genome and transcriptome assembly, variant analysis, RNASeq, differential expression and alternative splicing, annotation and validation among others. Library prep and RNA/DNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000 and PacBio RSII SMRT sequencing. Use GUI and CLI software to manipulate and analyze sequence data and assembly, mapping, annotation and analysis of Next Generation Sequencing data (long and short DNA length sequence). For transcriptome assembly I have used a combination of Abyss, CAP3, CD-HIT, BWA, STAR and Trinity. While for the annotation of assembled transcripts I use ESTScan, HMMER, Trinotate (including Transdecoder and NCBI+ blast) for homology search. RNASeq analyses included the use of the Tuxedo suite, DESeq2 and Cytoscape for GO term enrichment analysis, among others. Whole genome variant analyses included the use of aligners such as BWA, GMAP/GSNAP to map reads against reference genomes as well as the use of variant like GATK, Freebayes and Alpheus pipeline. Genome assembly validation and countinuity is peformed by using BUSCO, CEGMA and GAEMR. VEP and SnpEff are used for variant effect prediction. For the manipulation, parsing of genomic data and analysis of different type of NGS data, I use bedtools, vcftools/bcftools, vcflib, samtools, fastx toolkit, SnpSift and BASH/shell script programming with some Python and Perl, among others. Visualization of genomic data and results is performed in IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) and R."

  <br> <br>
  Analysis of next generation sequencing data for the de novo assembly, mapping and annotation of American cranberry nuclear and organellar genomes using 454 and Illumina data. Post analyses included SNP, SSR discovery and organellar structural rearrangements used in population genetic studies. The organellar genome assembly and annotation included the use of Newbler, Mitofy and DOGMA. Structural rearrangements were detected and visualized using Mummer, Geneious and Circos, respectively. Population genetic analyses were performed using GenAlEx and STRUCTURE."
